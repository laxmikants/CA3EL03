# PHP Recap üêò

## 1. Variables  
### 1. Variables
Variables store data values. In PHP, variables start with a `$` sign.
```php
$name = "Alice";
$age = 25;
```

### 2. Expressions
An expression is any combination of variables, values, and operators that results in a value.
```php
$sum = $a + $b;
```

### 3. Operators
Operators perform operations on variables and values (arithmetic, assignment, comparison, etc).
```php
$x = 10;
$y = 5;
$result = $x * $y; // Multiplication
```

### 4. Control Statements
Control statements manage the flow of execution (if, else, switch).
```php
if ($age >= 18) {
  echo "Adult";
} else {
  echo "Minor";
}
```

### 5. Loops
Loops execute a block of code repeatedly (for, while, foreach).
```php
for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
  echo $i;
}
```

### 6. Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code.
```php
function greet($name) {
  return "Hello, $name!";
}
```

### 7. Arrays
Arrays store multiple values in a single variable.
```php
$fruits = array("apple", "banana", "cherry");
```

### 8. Strings
Strings are sequences of characters.
```php
$greeting = "Hello, World!";
```

### 9. Classes and Objects
Classes define object blueprints; objects are instances of classes.
```php
class Car {
  public $brand = "Toyota";
}
$myCar = new Car();
```

### 10. Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to use properties and methods of another class.
```php
class Animal {
  public function makeSound() {
    echo "Some sound";
  }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
  public function makeSound() {
    echo "Bark";
  }
}
```

### 11. Interfaces
Interfaces define methods that implementing classes must have.
```php
interface Logger {
  public function log($msg);
}
class FileLogger implements Logger {
  public function log($msg) {
    echo $msg;
  }
}
```

### 12. Traits
Traits enable code reuse in single inheritance languages like PHP.
```php
trait Hello {
  public function sayHello() {
    echo "Hello!";
  }
}
class MyClass {
  use Hello;
}
```

### 13. Exceptions
Exceptions handle errors gracefully using try-catch blocks.
```php
try {
  throw new Exception("Error occurred");
} catch (Exception $e) {
  echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

### 14. Namespaces
Namespaces organize code and avoid name conflicts.
```php
namespace MyProject;
class MyClass {}
```

### 15. File Handling
File handling allows reading and writing files.
```php
$file = fopen("test.txt", "r");
fclose($file);
```

### 16. Superglobals
Superglobals are built-in variables accessible everywhere.
```php
echo $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'];
```

### 17. Sessions and Cookies
Sessions and cookies store user data across requests.
```php
// Session
session_start();
$_SESSION['user'] = "Alice";
// Cookie
setcookie("user", "Alice", time()+3600);
```

### 18. Forms Handling
Forms collect user input and process it in PHP.
```php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
  $name = $_POST['name'];
}
```

### 19. Database (MySQLi / PDO)
PHP can connect to databases using MySQLi or PDO.
```php
$conn = new mysqli("localhost", "user", "pass", "dbname");
```

### 20. Error Handling
Error handling manages runtime errors.
```php
error_reporting(E_ALL);
set_error_handler(function($errno, $errstr) {
  echo "Error: $errstr";
});
```
